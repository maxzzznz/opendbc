  it whenever the plan is not asking to move, and Honda asserts STANDSTILL for exactly as long

  plan's own -- LongControl already parks at CP.stopAccel while stopping, which for this car is
  the stock hold value.

  instant the body ECU latches its own brake hold (GEAR.BRAKE_HOLD), which can take anywhere
  from nothing to several seconds. If the latch never comes we simply keep braking.

  Nothing here latches: `holding` is recomputed every frame, so a plan that changes its mind
